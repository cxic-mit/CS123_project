### Using MapReduce to approximate Closeness Centrality
### Input: the communities (the center and the members) returned from 
###        â€œfind_comm_50.py" and the distance for each pair of user returned
###        from "Get_pairs_distance.py"    
### Output: "202"   ["202", 0.2774]
###         "203"   ["203", 0.5774]
###         "205"   ["304", 0.7071]
###         "208"   ["208", 0.3792]
###         "209"   ["210", 0.1906]
### The outputs' meaning: for the community whose original center is "202",
### the person with the highest closeness centrality is "202" and its 
### closeness centrality is 0.2774; for the community with the center of 
### "203", the person with the highest degree centrality is "203" and its 
### closeness centrality is 0.5774.
