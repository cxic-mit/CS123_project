### Using MapReduce to approximate Degree Centrality
### Input: the friendster data, whose format is"202: 203, 205, 208" and 
###        the communities constructed by â€œfind_comm_50.py"
### Output: "202"   ["395", 0.0204] 
###         "203"   ["395", 0.0204]
###         "205"   ["395", 0.0204]
###         "208"   ["208", 0.0612]
### The outputs' meaning: for the community whose original center is "202",
### the person with the highest degree centrality is "395" and its degree 
### centrality is 0.0204; for the community whose original center is "203",
### the person with the highest degree centrality is "395" and its degree 
### centrality is 0.0204.
