### Using MapReduce to approximate Eigenvector Centrality
### Input: the friendster data, whose format is "202: 203, 205, 208" and 
###        the communities (the center and the members) returned from 
###        â€œfind_comm_50.py"
### Output: "202"   ["395", 0.0204] 
###         "208"   ["208", 0.0612]
###         "209"   ["209", 0.5176]
###         "210"   ["209", 0.3858]
###         "211"   ["211", 0.5842]
### The outputs' meaning: for the community whose original center is "202",
### the person with the highest eigenvector centrality is "395" and its 
### eigenvector centrality is 0.0204; for the community with the center of 
### "208", the person with the highest eigenvector centrality is "208" and 
### its eigenvector centrality is 0.0612.
